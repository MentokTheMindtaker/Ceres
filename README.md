Incentivizing Earth Restoration through Digital Asset Issuance

Can we incentive behavior beneficial to the earth and environment through tokenizing those behaviors and assigning intrinsic value to them and how would be do this?
The first thought is to utilize an existing framework (carbon credits) and to pull that marketplace onto the XRPL.

An even better way is to redefine what the land and earth (ecosystem) represent. The ecosystem is humankind’s largest currently available warehouse. What is stored in this ecological warehouse? Potential value which is realized through extraction. When you remove matter from the earth, or goods from a warehouse, a debt is incurred unless the goods are replaced by something of equal quantity and quality.


How do we define the quantity and quality of these goods?
Metals and minerals are easily valued as there is robust market activity around these commodities. For carbon credits there is also market activity but not nearly as robust. And for yet other measures of potential value there are tangential markets, land costs based grazing units for cattle.

How is the value determined for biodiversity, or soil health?
We must create markets around these.

How do we create these markets?
An investor in earth restoration would fund a project to increase the intrinsic value of the local ecosystem.
When the project was complete some repeatable and certifiable tests or demonstrations of the improvements would be documented and/or valued.
There can be value found in biological diversity of an ecosystem (wetlands restoration), soil health (introducing organic matter to depleted soil), GHG reductions (carbon sequestration), plant cover (reforestation), and as yet unidentified factors.
The value of the unidentified factors would provide an incentive to seek them out as they would increase the total value of any projects returns. 

There are many unanswered questions that could be answered by a market place.
  Is separability of the factors comprising the intrinsic value of geophysical area beneficial, should biodiversity and carbon sequestration be tokenized separately?
  Should a project generate a unique digital asset with attached metadata detailing the results of the project and its associated value?
  Should the project value be based on an accredited valuation by an auditor or should it be measured in physical results to be valued by the market? 
  How are these assets “burned” or offset?
  Introduction of negative balances for degradation of potential?
  
How do we test this?
  Fund a project to improve soil health in a depleted region.
  Measure soil conditions
  Plant hemp
  Measure carbon content of hemp after harvest
  Introduce hemp into soil
  Measure soil conditions after biodegradtion of the hemp
  Issue the resulting increase in soil conditions and carbon sequestration as a token or NFT on the blockchain
